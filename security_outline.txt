This file contains a brief overview of the network topology which should be used for the packages in this repository. Note that this document assumes that connections between nodes are made in a secure, encrypted tunnel.

The system uses a controller-relay architecture, whereby all API calls should be made through a relay node. The receiver node will then forward the message to the controller node, which processes the request and sends a reply back to the caller through the relay. The benefit of this architecture is that the relay nodes can be configured as "trusted" or "not trusted"; that is, all relayed messages have a header inserted which indicates whether the message comes from a "trusted" source (i.e., an internal source). This means that the "trusted" state of the API caller is known so long as the relay nodes can be trusted to only accept connections from trusted callers. In the specific context in which these packages were originally used (the "OpenComputers" Minecraft mod), connections must be approved individually, and so this architecture leaves (should leave) no options for an attacker to emulate a trusted caller.
